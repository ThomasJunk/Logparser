Logparser
=========

A simple Log4J parser - usefull throw-away code

It was started for two reasons:

1) I had the need in production to filter LOG4J logs with something easier than simply grep

2) I started learning python. So it was a first "real world" attempt to make something more useful beyond "hello world"

Though it was for personal use only - I hope someone finds it usefull or improves it.
